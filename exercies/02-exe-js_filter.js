// ONLY USE THE .filter() METHOD FOR THIS EXERCISE

//Exercise 1: Given an array of numbers, filter out the numbers that are not even, and are less than 100.
const numbers = [1, 60, 112, 123, 100, 99, 73, 35];

const evenNumbers = (arr) => {
   //your code here...
}

let myEvenNumbers = evenNumbers(numbers)
console.log(myEvenNumbers) // [1,99,73,35]

// Exercise 2: From the given array of people, get the people who are allowed to consume alcoholic beverages (i.e age > 21).
const people = [
  { name: "Candice", age: 25 },
  { name: "Tammy", age: 30 },
  { name: "Allen", age: 49 },
  { name: "Nettie", age: 21 },
  { name: "Stuart", age: 17 },
  { name: "Bill", age: 19 }
];

const adults = (arr) => {
   //your code here...
}

let canConsume = adults(people)
console.log(canConsume) 

/* Answer should be 
[
  { name: "Candice", age: 25 },
  { name: "Tammy", age: 30 },
  { name: "Allen", age: 49 },
]
*/

// Bonus: Using the same array above Just return the first two names of people eligible to drink. (i.e age > 21).
// might need to use a .map() here later at some point
// might also need to use another array method here which we haven't seen. Google it!, Again its a "MIGHT"
const people = [
  { name: "Candice", age: 25 },
  { name: "Tammy", age: 30 },
  { name: "Allen", age: 49 },
  { name: "Nettie", age: 21 },
  { name: "Stuart", age: 17 },
  { name: "Bill", age: 19 }
];

const adults = (arr) => {
   //your code here...
}

let canConsumeTwo = adults(people)
console.log(canConsumeTwo) 
//Answer should be ['Candice', 'Tammy']

// FILTER

// Challenge 1:

// 1. In the given array, find the elements that start with "m" and make them capitalized.

const cities = ["miami", "barcelona", "madrid", "amsterdam", "berlin", "sao paulo", "lisbon", "mexico city", "paris"];

const citiesWithM =    //your code...

console.log(citiesWithM);
